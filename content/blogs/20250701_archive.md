The posts marked with the "archive" tag are relics from a previous chapter of my digital life, migrated from a Web Archive snapshot of my first blog, [fishesplace.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20210302085730/https://fishesplace.com/). They represent a time capsule of my early days as a programmer, particularly my foray into Unity game development.

While the original images from these posts have been lost to time, their essence remains. This collection stands as a digital monument to where my journey beganâ€”a time of job searching and portfolio building that ultimately led to my first role as a backend engineer.

Now, my perspective has evolved significantly since those early days of manually backing up a **LAMP** and **WordPress** site. Reflecting on that initial process, I'm struck by how much has changed and the numerous improvements I can now implement:

- **Robust Version Control**: Managing all content, CMS, and infra through Git for better tracking and collaboration.

- **Streamlined CI/CD**: Implementing automated pipelines for seamless releases and rapid rollbacks.

- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Establishing comprehensive oversight of site traffic, performance, and uptime.

- **Resource Management**: Setting limits, requirements of system resources for each component so that failed services won't tear down the whole system.

I invite you to follow this series and my repos as I document the redevelopment of this platform, sharing insights gained from years of experience in a professional software engineering environment. Stay tuned for in-depth articles on this modernization journey.
